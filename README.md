### Finally it's here!
I would also like to invite you to try out this variant if you have an ECU-R (or ECU-B?). 
Tell me what you think and which you prefer. https://github.com/HAEdwin/homeassistant-apsystems_ecu_proxy

# Home-Assistant APsystems ECU Integration
ðŸ“¢ We have reached a milestone of 700 active installations ðŸŽ‰

This is an integration for [Home-Assistant](http://home-assistant.io) that adds support for the [APsystems](http://www.apsystems.com) Energy Communication Unit (ECU) so that you are able to monitor your PV installation (inverters) in detail. It currently supports one ECU (one instance of the integration) but a work-around is available https://github.com/ksheumaker/homeassistant-apsystems_ecur/issues/142

Note: This integration was initially written for the older ECU-R (2160xxxxxxxx series) and is fully compatible with the ECU-B. For later ECU-R models (SunSpec logo/ECU-ID starting with 2162xxxxxxxx) and ECU-C owners, usage of this integration results in ECU outage over time. From version 1.2.21 the integration will restart the ECU automatically. This can be monitored by the "binary_sensor.restart_ecu". Unfortunately this is a firmware issue which can't be solved by the integration.


## Background & acknowledgement
This integration queries the ECU with a set interval for new data. This was done without a public API, and by listening to and interpreting the protocol the APSystems ECU phone app (ECUapp) uses when setting up the PV array. This couldn't have been done without the hardwork of @checking12 and @HAEdwin on the home assistant forum, and all the other people from this forum (https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/2032302/1). Thanks goes out to @12christiaan and @ViperRNMC for providing an automated solution to restart the ECU-C and ECU-R (SunSpec logo/ECU-ID starting with 2162xxxxxxxx) models.

## Prerequisites
You own an APSystems ECU model ECU-B, ECU-R or ECU-C and any combination of YC600, YC1000/QT2, DS3/DS3D, DS3-H or QS1/QS1A inverter. If your inverter is not supported, please raise an issue. Your ECU is connected to your LAN, correctly configured (assigned a fixed IP address) and Home Assistant has free access to it. You also have HACS installed in Home Assistant. You allready have an APsystemsema (Energy Monitoring & Analysis System) account and are succesfully uploading data to the EMA site.
Connection method (ethernet or WiFi) depends on your ECU model, follow the table below.
Connection required | ECU Model | Automated Restart* | Turn on/off Inverters
--- | --- | --- | ---
Wireless | ECU-R (2160xxxxxxxx series) and ECU-B | No | No
Wireless | ECU-R (SunSpec logo/ECU-ID starting with 2162xxxxxxxx) | Yes | Yes
Wired | ECU-C | Yes | Yes

ECU-3 owners might want to take a look at: https://github.com/jeeshofone/ha-apc-ecu-3

### Configure your wireless ECU connection
1. **Install EMA Manager**: 
Download and install the EMA Manager app on your mobile device from the appropriate app store.
1. **Put ECU-R in Access Point Mode**: 
Locate the physical button on your ECU-R router. Press and hold the button for a few seconds until the router's Wi-Fi starts. You should see it in your accessible WIFI networks of your device (phone). This indicates that the router is in Access Point mode.
1. **Connect to ECU-R Wi-Fi**:
Use your mobile device to connect to the newly created Wi-Fi network from your ECU-R router.
The default Wi-Fi password is 88888888.
1. **Launch EMA Manager**:
Open the EMA Manager app on your device.
Choose the "Local" connection option. The app should automatically detect and connect to your ECU-R router.
1. **Configure ECU-R Network Settings**:
Once connected, use the EMA Manager app to configure the ECU-R's network settings.
Connect the ECU-R to the same Wi-Fi network as your Home Assistant.

### Test your connection and find your ECU on the LAN
Final step to the prerequisites is testing the connection between HomeAssistant and the ECU. Sometimes it is difficult to find the ECU among all the other nodes, especially if you have many IOT devices. In any case, look for **Espressif Inc. or ESP** because the ECU's WiFi interface is from this brand. Testing the connection can be done from the terminal using the Netcat command, follow the example below but use the correct (fixed) IP address of your ECU. If connected you'll see line 2, then type in the command APS1100160001END if you get a response (line 4) you are ready to install the integration. If not, power cycle your ECU wait for it to get started and try again. **It is highly recommended to assign a fixed IP-Address to the ECU**.
```
[core-ssh .storage]$ nc -v 172.16.0.4 8899 <â”˜
172.16.0.4 (172.16.0.4:8899) open
APS1100160001END <â”˜
APS11009400012160000xxxxxxxz%10012ECU_R_1.2.22009Etc/GMT-8
```
Sometimes you might see the "Unknown error occurred" message. Installation can best be done in the daytime when inverters are running.

## Pre-release/Beta program
If you're having trouble with the integration or you would like to help debugging/testing, consider joining the beta program. I am not able to test all ECU models as well as firmware versions so I could use some help there. To do this, select HACS > Integrations > click on APSystems ECU-R > Select the three dots (overflow menu) in the top right corner > Redownload > switch on the "Show beta versions" switch. In HA you will now also see notifications when there is a beta release. You are always able to roll-back to an official release. Please provide us with feedback when using beta releases.

Feel free to participate by adding your language to the integration but remember to reload the page, labels might be invisible due to browser caching.

## Install Integration
**This is not a Home Assistant Add-On**, it's a custom component/integration. Install the integration using HACS by searching for "APSystems ECU-R". If you are unable to find the integration in HACS, select HACS in left pane. In the top pane you can find the overflow menu (three dots above eachother). Select Custom Repositories and add the URL: https://github.com/ksheumaker/homeassistant-apsystems_ecur below that select category Integration. Choose ADD-button and then click on the repository (with the wastebasket behind it). The homepage of the integration will open and in the lower right corner you will find the Download-button. Choose the version and click Download. Now restart Home Assistant by going to [Settings] > [System] and select [restart] in the upper right corner. After restart, next step will be the configuration.

## Configuration
Choose [Configuration] > [Devices & Services] > [+ Add Integration] and search for "APSystems PV solar ECU" which enables you to configure the integration settings. Provide the IP-address from the ECU (no leading zero's), and set the update interval (300 seconds is the recommended default).
_It's good to know that the ECU only contains new data once every 5 minutes so a smaller interval does not update info more often._ The optional fields [Specify SSID] and [Specify password] are the parameters you would like to assign to the ECU when an automatic software restart is being applied (for ECU-R (sunspec) and ECU-C models only). These parameters are not being used during setup. If setup fails, in most cases the wrong IP-address was specified. After selecting [Submit] the integration will setup the entities in around 12 seconds.

## Data caching
The integration uses caching when needed (present previous data). **Tip: Use the binary_sensor.ecu_using_cached_data sensor to monitor the use of caching. If the use of caching is too often read on!**

The reason for this is that the ECU does not always respond to data requests (due to other I/O tasks the ECU performs for example during maintenance tasks that take place on the ECU around 02.45-03.15 AM local time or due to timing changes an EMA upload initiated from the ECU can conflict with a query initiated from this integration). In most cases a 'time out' occurs, these are suppressed in the homeassistant.log and do no harm. Practice shows that it is then best to use the old data until the ECU responds again to the next query interval. If you experience cache usage frequently, try relocating the ECU. Some users even experience improvements by removing the WiFi antenna from the ECU.

![Integration data caching](https://github.com/ksheumaker/homeassistant-apsystems_ecur/blob/main/integration_cache.jpg)

*The integration uses the cache a set number of times but this number will reset if a successfull query took place. Only after the set number of times consecutively will the integration assume that something else is going on, such as a stuck ECU. On the older ECU-R models (UID 2160xxxxx) and ECU-B this is not very common, on ECU-C and ECU-R (UID 2162xxxxx) models it is - the integration will restart your ECU automatically if this happens. Because an automated restart is not available on the older ECU model the switch will disable querying immediately. You can use an automation to send a notify if this happens. **Don't forget to turn the ECU Query Device switch back on**.

## Using the ECU Query Device switch
Although you can query the ECU 24/7, it is an option to stop the query after sunset and start the query again at sunrise. This is especially useful if too many query errors occur after sunset or during ECU maintenance. If you prefer to temporary stop querying the ECU, you can create an automation that flips the switch. manually flipping the switch causes the cache to be used the next intervals until an automation flips the switch on again. **It is recommended to place the switch on the dashboard so that you are able to see the state. The switch will turn off when the cache is used the set number of consecutively times**.

## Using the ECU Inverters Online switch
For newer type ECU-R pro and ECU-C devices you are able to switch off the inverters when electricity prices become negative. The change will happen immediately but will only be visible instantly on a P1 meter for example. The ECU data is updated after max 5 minutes. Use the switch in automations to anticipate on electricity prices. For the older ECU-R's starting with ECU-id 2160 and ECU-B this switch will ***not*** function, the switch will be kept on and a log message is posted.

## The temperature sensors
When the inverters are turned off at sundown the ECU returns zero for inverters temperature. Users prefer to keep them as null values instead of zero so the graphs are not being updated during the offline periods. In return, this causes a non-numeric error message for the gauge if you use that as a temperature indicator. In that case you can use this template part in configuration.yaml which converts the value to zero:
```
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      temperature_non_numeric_4080xxxxxxxx:
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.inverter_4080xxxxxxxx_temperature')|float(0) }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
      temperature_non_numeric_8060xxxxxxxx:
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.inverter_8060xxxxxxxx_temperature')|float(0) }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
```

## Data exposed devices and entities (and how to create derived sensors)
The integration supports getting data from the PV array as a whole as well as each individual inverter in detail.
ECU and inverters will be exposed in Home Assistant. As a result the following sensors and switch can be used.

### ECU Sensors
* sensor.ecu_current_power - total amount of power (in W) being generated right now
* sensor.ecu_inverters - total number of configured inverters in the ECU
* sensor.ecu_inverters_online - total number of configured online inverters in the ECU 
* sensor.ecu_today_energy - total amount of energy (in kWh) generated today now
* sensor.ecu_lifetime_energy - total amount of energy (in kWh) generated from the lifetime of the array
* binary_sensor.ecu_restart - indicates a restart of the ECU
* binary_sensor.ecu_using_cached_data - indicates the usage of cached data

### Inverter Level Sensors (Array)
A new device will be created for each inverter called `Inverter_[UID]` where [UID] is the unique ID of the Inverter
* sensor.inverter_[UID]_frequency - the AC power frequency in Hz
* sensor.inverter_[UID]_voltage - the AC voltage in V
* sensor.inverter_[UID]_temperature - the temperature of the invertor in your local unit (C or F)
* sensor.inverter_[UID]_signal - the signal strength of the zigbee connection
* sensor.inverter_[UID]\_power_ch_[1-4] - the current power generation (in W) of each channel (model depentent) of the inverter

### Removing devices
If an inverter fails and hardware is replaced, the old inverter can be easily removed from within the Device info card. The device is removed from the core.device_registry and placed under the "deleted devices" category.

### Switches
* switch.ecu_query_device - switch will turn off after the user configured number of intervals if cached data is used.
This switch enable the user to create automations based on the state of the switch (restart ECU or temporary pause query during night time).
* switch.ecu_inverters_online - switch the inverters on/off. This will happen immediately but is at max visible after the next 5 minute update.

### How to derive new sensors from excisting sensors
* Total power for each inverter: Settings > Devices and Services > Helpers (top of the screen) > +Create Helper > +/- Combine the state of several sensors
* Show the total_energy_yesterday: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/statistic-sensor-reset-clear-at-midnight-for-daily-min-max-temperature/501688/8

## TODO
Code cleanup - it probably needs some work
